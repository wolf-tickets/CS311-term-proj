Initial level commitment (80%, 90%, or 100%): 100%

Tutorial time that at least one and ideally all members will guarantee to attend
each week: Wednesday - 2pm

3+ hours weekly that the group guarantees EACH OTHER to be available
to meet (ideally face-to-face): Thursday -  [1pm -- ??]  - Alâ€™s House

Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project. Note:
Each idea should be plausible enough to show that the group has done
some thought and reading about it. Each should have the potential to
develop into a real project. Together, they should explore some
meaningfully distinct project options (so, not just three variations
on the same project).

1. Extend a Hardware description language like VHDL to include analog circuitry - resistors, capacitors, current/voltage sources.

2. DSL to construct VST (digital audio processing/generation plugins) easily and quickly (currently must be done laboriously in C++).

3. Implement (a possibly modified subset of) blazonry, the traditional DSL for describing a Heraldic coat of arms, in the hope that pattern-match-parsing and an abstract syntax close to the concrete syntax will help resolve ambiguities.
